## ✨ About Me

I am studying a Bachelor of Software Engineering (Honours) at UNSW. I am highly passionate about learning to solve real-world problems by developing innovative applications and tools. I have experience in various domains such as AI, machine learning, software engineering, and web development. My projects range from a sorting algorithm visualizer and a Kahoot clone backend to a house price predictor and a sentiment analyzer. I am eager to expand my skills and apply them to projects that will positively impact the world! 🚀
